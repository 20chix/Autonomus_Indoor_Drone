# A basic drone controller class for the tutorial "Up and flying with the AR.Drone and ROS | Getting Started"
# https://github.com/mikehamer/ardrone_tutorials_getting_started

# This class implements basic control functionality which we will be using in future tutorials.
# It can command takeoff/landing/emergency as well as drone movement
# It also tracks the drone state based on navdata feedback

# Import the ROS libraries, and load the manifest file which through <depend package=... /> will give us access to the project dependencies
import roslib; roslib.load_manifest('ardrone_tutorials')
import rospy

# Import the messages we're interested in sending and receiving
from geometry_msgs.msg import Twist  	 # for sending commands to the drone
from std_msgs.msg import Empty       	 # for land/takeoff/emergency
from ardrone_autonomy.msg import Navdata # for receiving navdata feedback

# An enumeration of Drone Statuses
from drone_status import DroneStatus


# Some Constants
COMMAND_PERIOD = 100 #ms
